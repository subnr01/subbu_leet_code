/*

You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. 
You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:

Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.

For example, given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2). The point (1,2) is an 
ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.
