/*

Given a picture consisting of black and white pixels, find the number of black lonely pixels.

The picture is represented by a 2D char array consisting of 'B' and 'W', which means black and white pixels respectively.

A black lonely pixel is character 'B' that located at a specific position where the same row and same column don't have any other black pixels.

Example:
Input: 
[['W', 'W', 'B'],
 ['W', 'B', 'W'],
 ['B', 'W', 'W']]

Output: 3
Explanation: All the three 'B's are black lonely pixels.

/**
 * suppose matrix is m*n, there is at most min(m, n) lonely pixels, because there could be no more than 1 in each row, or column;
 * therefore, if we record num of black pixel on each row and column, we can easily tell whether each pixel is lonely or NO.
