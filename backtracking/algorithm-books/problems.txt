Given an undirected graph, it is required to color each vertex in C with one
of three colors, such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
If two adjacent vertices have the same color, then it is illegal.


Given a set of integers X = {x1,x2,x3...} and an integer y, find 
a subset Y of X, whose sum is equal to y.
if X = {10,20,30,40,50,60}
and Y = 60
then solutions: {10,20,30}, {20,40} and {60}

Design a backtracking algorithm to generate all permutations of
a numbers 1,2,3..n

Design a backtracking algorithm to generate subsets

Write a backtracking algorithm for a knight tour problem. Given a chess board, 
decide if it is possible for a knight placed at a certain postion in the board
to visit every square of the board exactly once and return to its start postion


Given an undirected graph, determine whether it contains a simple cycle
that visits each vertex exactly once. (hamiltonian cycle)

Give an algorithm for the assignment problem. Given n employees to be assigned
to n jobs such the cost of assigning the ith person to the jth person is
C(ij). Find the assignment that minimizes the cost.

Use the Backtracking algorithm for the 0â€“1 Knapsack problem
