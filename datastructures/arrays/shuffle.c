/*

Given an array, write a program to generate a random permutation of array elements. 
This question is also asked as “shuffle a deck of cards” or “randomize a given array”.


/*
Algorithm

To shuffle an array a of n elements (indices 0..n-1):
  for i from n - 1 downto 1 do
       j = random integer with 0 <= j <= i
       exchange a[j] and a[i]

// A function to generate a random permutation of arr[]
void randomize ( int arr[], int n )
{
    // Use a different seed value so that we don't get same
    // result each time we run this program
    srand ( time(NULL) );
 
    // Start from the last element and swap one by one. We don't
    // need to run for the first element that's why i > 0
    for (int i = n-1; i > 0; i--)
    {
        // Pick a random index from 0 to i
        int j = rand() % (i+1);
 
        // Swap arr[i] with the element at random index
        swap(&arr[i], &arr[j]);
    }
