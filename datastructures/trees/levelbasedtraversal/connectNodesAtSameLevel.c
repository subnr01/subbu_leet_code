/*
Write a function to connect all the adjacent nodes at the same level in a binary tree. 
Structure of the given Binary Tree node is like following.

struct node {
  int data;
  struct node* left;
  struct node* right;
  struct node* nextRight;
}
Initially, all the nextRight pointers point to garbage values. Your function should set
these pointers to point next right for each node. You can use only constant extra space.

Example

Input Tree
       A
      / \
     B   C
    / \   \
   D   E   F

Output Tree
       A--->NULL
      / \
     B-->C-->NULL
    / \   \
   D-->E-->F-->NULL

Recursive solution

In the method 2 of previous post, we traversed the nodes in pre order fashion. Instead of traversing in Pre Order fashion (root, left, right), if we traverse the nextRight node before the left and right children (root, nextRight, left), then we can make sure that all nodes at level i have the nextRight set, before the level i+1 nodes. Let us consider the following example (same example as previous post). The method 2 fails for right child of node 4. In this method, we make sure that all nodes at the 4â€™s level (level 2) have nextRight set, before we try to set the nextRight of 9. So when we set the nextRight of 9, we search for a nonleaf node on right side of node 4 (getNextRight() does this for us).

            1            -------------- Level 0
          /    \
        2        3       -------------- Level 1
       / \      /  \
      4   5    6    7    -------------- Level 2
     / \           / \
    8   9        10   11 -------------- Level 3
void connectRecur(struct node* p);
struct node *getNextRight(struct node *p);
 
// Sets the nextRight of root and calls connectRecur() for other nodes
void connect (struct node *p)
{
    // Set the nextRight for root
    p->nextRight = NULL;
 
    // Set the next right for rest of the nodes (other than root)
    connectRecur(p);
}

Steps:

1. if nextRight != NULL, make sure all nextRights are connected by recursively 
   calling connectRecur(p->nextRight)

2. if left != NULL and right != NULL, then connect left->nextRight to right and connect rightNext of 
   right to getNextRight(p)

3. if left != NULL but right is NULL, then connect left using getNextRight(p);

4. After we do this we go top to bottom and invoke connectRecur(p->left);

5. Now if left == NULL and right is not NULL, then connect connect rightNext of 
   right to getNextRight(p). Now invoke connectRecur(p->right) for a top down bottom approach

6. If both are NULL, then connectRecur(getNextRight(p));

nextRight of nodes ar level i is set before level i+1 nodes. */

    children of other nodes using p's nextRight only) */
