 /*
 Consider lines of slope -1 passing between nodes (dotted lines in below diagram). Diagonal sum in a binary tree is sum 
 of all nodeâ€™s data lying between these lines. Given a Binary Tree, print all diagonal sums.

For the following input tree, output should be 9, 19, 42.
9 is sum of 1, 3 and 5.
19 is sum of 2, 6, 4 and 7.
42 is sum of 9, 10, 11 and 12.

        1
    2       3
 9      6  4    5   
  10  11  12 7

/*

The idea is to keep track of vertical distance from top diagonal passing through root. We increment the
vertical distance we go down to next diagonal.
1. Add root with vertical distance as 0 to the queue.
2. Process the sum of all right child and right of right child and so on.
3. Add left child current node into the queue for later processing. The vertical distance of left child is 
   vertical distance of current node plus 1.
4. Keep doing 2nd, 3rd and 4th step till the queue is empty.
