Find the maximum path sum between two leaves of a binary tree Given a binary
tree in which each node element contains a number. Find the maximum possible sum
from one leaf node to another. 

The maximum sum path may or may not go through
root. For example, in the following binary tree, 
the maximum sum is 27(3 + 6 + 9 + 0 â€“ 1 + 10). 
Expected time complexity is O(n).
