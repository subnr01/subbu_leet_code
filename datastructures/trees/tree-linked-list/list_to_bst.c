/*
Solution

The method 1 constructs the tree from root to leaves. In this method, we
construct from leaves to root. The idea is to insert nodes in BST in the same
order as the appear in Linked List, so that the tree can be constructed in
O(n) time complexity. We first count the number of nodes in the given Linked
List. Let the count be n. After counting nodes, we take left n/2 nodes and
recursively construct the left subtree. After left subtree is constructed, we
allocate memory for root and link the left subtree with root. Finally, we
recursively construct the right subtree and link it with root. While
constructing the BST, we also keep moving the list head pointer to next so
that we have the appropriate pointer in each recursive call.
