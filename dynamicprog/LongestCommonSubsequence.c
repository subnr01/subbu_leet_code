/* 

Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both
of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order,
but not necessarily contiguous. For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”,
‘”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of “abcdefg”. So a string of length n has 2^n
different possible subsequences.

Examples:
LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.
LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB” of length 4.

Optimal substructure

Let the input sequences be X[0..m-1] and Y[0..n-1] of lengths m and n respectively. 
And let L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) be the length of LCS of the two sequences X and Y. 
Following is the recursive definition of L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]).

If last characters of both sequences match (or X[m-1] == Y[n-1]) then
L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = 1 + L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-2])

If last characters of both sequences do not match (or X[m-1] != Y[n-1]) then
L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = MAX ( L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-1]), L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-2])

Examples:
1) Consider the input strings “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB”. Last characters match for the strings. 
So length of LCS can be written as:
L(“AGGTAB”, “GXTXAYB”) = 1 + L(“AGGTA”, “GXTXAY”)

2) Consider the input strings “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR. Last characters do not match
for the strings. So length of LCS can be written as: L(“ABCDGH”, “AEDFHR”) = MAX
( L(“ABCDG”, “AEDFHR”), L(“ABCDGH”, “AEDFH”) )
