/*

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is 
expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

For example:

2, [[1,0]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 
you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

Note:
The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph
is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

Solution:
Since pair<int, int> is inconvenient for the implementation of graph algorithms, we first transform it to a graph. If course u is a prerequisite of course v, we will add a directed edge from node u to node v.

class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<pair<int, int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<unordered_set<int>> graph = make_graph(numCourses, prerequisites);
        vector<bool> onpath(numCourses, false), visited(numCourses, false);
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++)
            if (!visited[i] && dfs_cycle(graph, i, onpath, visited))
                return false;
        return true;
    }
private:
    vector<unordered_set<int>> make_graph(int numCourses, vector<pair<int, int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<unordered_set<int>> graph(numCourses);
        for (auto pre : prerequisites)
            graph[pre.second].insert(pre.first);
        return graph;
    } 
    bool dfs_cycle(vector<unordered_set<int>>& graph, int node, vector<bool>& onpath, vector<bool>& visited) {
        if (visited[node]) return false;
        onpath[node] = visited[node] = true; 
        for (int neigh : graph[node])
            if (onpath[neigh] || dfs_cycle(graph, neigh, onpath, visited))
                return true;
        return onpath[node] = false;
    }
};
