/*
Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that 
is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements 
(eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Examples:
Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.

Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
