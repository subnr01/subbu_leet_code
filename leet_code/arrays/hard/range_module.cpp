/*
A Range Module is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. Your task is to design and implement the following 
interfaces in an efficient manner.

addRange(int left, int right) Adds the half-open interval [left, right), tracking every real number in that interval.
Adding an interval that partially overlaps with currently tracked numbers should add any numbers in the 
interval [left, right) that are not already tracked.
queryRange(int left, int right) Returns true if and only if every real number in the interval [left, right) is
currently being tracked.
removeRange(int left, int right) Stops tracking every real number currently being tracked in the interval [left, right).

Example 1:
addRange(10, 20): null
removeRange(14, 16): null
queryRange(10, 14): true (Every number in [10, 14) is being tracked)
queryRange(13, 15): false (Numbers like 14, 14.03, 14.17 in [13, 15) are not being tracked)
queryRange(16, 17): true (The number 16 in [16, 17) is still being tracked, despite the remove operation)
Note:

A half open interval [left, right) denotes all real numbers left <= x < right.
0 < left < right < 10^9 in all calls to addRange, queryRange, removeRange.
The total number of calls to addRange in a single test case is at most 1000.
The total number of calls to queryRange in a single test case is at most 5000.
The total number of calls to removeRange in a single test case is at most 1000.

Soln
The solution using vector of intervals (pair<int, int>) is very straightforward. The runtime is O(n) for addRange and 
deleteRange, and O(logn) for queryRange, where n is total number of intervals.

Another option is to use map (ordered map). And the runtime is still O(logn) for queryRange, but O(klogn) 
for addRange and deleteRange, where k is number of overlapping ranges.

For a single operation, it is hard to tell whether vector or map is better, because k is unknown. However, 
the k overlapping ranges will be erased after either add or remove ranges. Letâ€™s assume m is the total
operations of add or delete ranges. Then total number of possible ranges is O(m) because add or 
delete may increase ranges by 1. So both n and k is O(m).

In summary, the run time for query is the same. However, the total run time for add and delete using vector 
is O(m^2), and that using map is O(mlogm). So amortized cost for delete and add is O(m) for vector, and O(logm) for map.
