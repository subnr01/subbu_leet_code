/*
Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of 
last word in the string.
If the last word does not exist, return 0.
Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.
For example, 
Given s = "Hello World",
return 5.
*/

Points to note here:
-- Traverse from the end and jump over all the spaces.
-- Till the first space of the last word, gives the length.

        int len = 0, tail = s.length() - 1;
        while (tail >= 0 && s[tail] == ' ') tail--;
