/*

We had some 2-dimensional coordinates, like "(1, 3)" or "(2, 0.5)".  
Then, we removed all commas, decimal points, and spaces, and ended up with the string S.  Return a list of strings representing all possibilities for what our original coordinates could have been.

Example 1:
Input: "(123)"
Output: ["(1, 23)", "(12, 3)", "(1.2, 3)", "(1, 2.3)"]
Example 2:
Input: "(00011)"
Output:  ["(0.001, 1)", "(0, 0.011)"]
Explanation: 
0.0, 00, 0001 or 00.01 are not allowed.
Example 3:
Input: "(0123)"
Output: ["(0, 123)", "(0, 12.3)", "(0, 1.23)", "(0.1, 23)", "(0.1, 2.3)", "(0.12, 3)"]
Example 4:
Input: "(100)"
Output: [(10, 0)]
Explanation: 
1.0 is not allowed.
