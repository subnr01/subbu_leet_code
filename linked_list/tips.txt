1. There seems to be a difference between spltting a linkedlist and finding a loop.

Splitting a linked list:

while (fast!=NULL && fast->next->next != NULL)
{
  slow=slow->next;
  fast=fast->next->next;
}

Finding a loop
while (fast->next!=NULL && fast->next->next != NULL)
{
  slow=slow->next;
  fast=fast->next->next;
}

In palindrome, we are using this to split the linked list
while (fast!=NULL && fast->next->next != NULL)
{
  slow=slow->next;
  fast=fast->next->next;
}
if (fast->next)
{
  slow = slow->next;
}


Need to sort deleting an element by taking its address.
If you are already at a node and you are removing the node, 
what happend to the previous node that is alreay pointing to it.
Does it become dangling.
