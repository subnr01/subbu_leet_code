1. Palindromic substrings DP not well understood
2. longest_file_path.cpp is not included in strings medium, so need to look at it seperately.
3. split_concatenated_str.cpp is not clear, look for other solns.
4. Take multiple looks at the parser problem. It is a good pattern to remember.
5. Reverse strings 2 uses vectors. Need to fix that.
6. Longest palindromic substring IS A GOOD PROBLEM, take multiple looks.

Things left:
1. Longest uncommon subsequence 2
2. Multiply strings
3. Optimal division
4. Remove comments
5. zigzag conversion
6. integer to roman
